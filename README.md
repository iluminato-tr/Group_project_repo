1. Installation

Clone the GitHub repository

Clone the GitHub repository of the web application to your local machine. This will create a local copy of the project repository on your machine, allowing you to access and modify the application's source code.

Install required dependencies

Install the required Python dependencies listed in the requirments.txt file using the pip package manager. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install all the necessary Python packages and libraries specified in the requirements.txt file, ensuring that the application has all the required dependencies to run smoothly.
